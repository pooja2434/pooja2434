3. üêç Python Automation
  This Project Contain [Report Automation by using Python](https://github.com/pooja2434/Report-Automation-Python-Project) This project automates data cleaning, SQL query execution, and email reporting. It is modular, secure, and designed to run via Anaconda Prompt or be scheduled using batch scripts / Task Scheduler. Report Automation with Python

Objective:
Automate repetitive reporting workflows by extracting, transforming, and distributing data insights with minimal manual effort.

Key Features:
* Data Extraction: Connects to SQL databases / CSV files to fetch raw data.
* Data Transformation: Cleans and preprocesses datasets using pandas (handling nulls, formatting, aggregations).
* Automated Reports: Generates daily/weekly reports in Excel, PDF, or email format.
* Email Automation: Sends reports with attachments to recipients via SMTP (with To and CC support).
* Error Handling: Built-in exception handling and logging to track failures.

Tech Stack:
* Python: pandas, smtplib, openpyxl, reportlab
* SQL: Querying databases for live data
* Scheduling: Automated runs using cron (Linux) / Task Scheduler (Windows)

Workflow:
* Fetch raw data (SQL / CSV).
* Clean & transform data with Python.
* Create summarized reports (Excel/PDF).
* Email reports to stakeholders automatically.

Benefits:
* Saves 4‚Äì6 hours per week by eliminating manual reporting.
* Ensures accuracy and consistency of data reports.
* Provides timely insights to stakeholders with zero human delay.
